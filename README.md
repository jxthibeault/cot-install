## About
The purpose of this database application is to manage the intake, processing, fulfillment and post-processing of commercial equipment installation work orders. Specifically, this application is designed for management of commercial print equipment (copiers, multi-function systems, printers, etc.) installation.

This application is also designed to facilitate a specific workflow for work order processing from receiving through post-processing to ensure a uniform handling process.

This application is intended for deployment in a small-to-mid-sized production environment; the offically recommended user count is 50 or less. This application is intended to run from a single shared resource to eliminate the need for a complex client-server configuration in production environments (lightweight configuration).
